UIkit should be learned as an extension skill.
Start with SwiftUI since it is the most recent version of Apple's UI framework.

Common mistakes:
  - Memorizing everything
  - Shiny object syndrome
  - Lone wolf learning
  - Using beta software
  - Relying on Apple's documentation
  - Getting lost in Objective-C
  - Taking shots at other languages

Memorization is a trap. Don't try to memorize everything.
Repetition is important for learning.
